# Character GraphQL Service

A small GraphQL-based service for managing "character" resources used in learning exercises. This README explains how to install, run, and test the service, and shows example queries and mutations.

## Features
- GraphQL API exposing Character types and operations
- Basic CRUD: create, read, update, delete
- Simple in-memory or file-backed data store (configurable)
- Minimal, easy-to-read schema for learning purposes

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ (or compatible)
- npm or yarn

## Installation
1. Clone or copy this repository into the `character` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
    - npm: `npm install`
    - yarn: `yarn install`

## Running the project
Start the GraphQL server:
- npm: `npm start`
- yarn: `yarn start`

By default the server listens at `http://localhost:4000` (or the console-specified port). Open the GraphQL Playground (or GraphiQL) to explore the schema and run queries.

## Example GraphQL schema (conceptual)
- type Character { id: ID!, name: String!, species: String, age: Int }
- queries: `characters`, `character(id: ID!)`
- mutations: `createCharacter(input)`, `updateCharacter(id, input)`, `deleteCharacter(id)`

## Example queries & mutations

Fetch all characters:
```graphql
query {
  characters {
     id
     name
     species
     age
  }
}
```

Fetch a single character:
```graphql
query {
  character(id: "1") {
     id
     name
     species
     age
  }
}
```

Create a character:
```graphql
mutation {
  createCharacter(input: { name: "Astra", species: "Human", age: 28 }) {
     id
     name
     species
     age
  }
}
```

Update a character:
```graphql
mutation {
  updateCharacter(id: "1", input: { age: 29 }) {
     id
     name
     species
     age
  }
}
```

Delete a character:
```graphql
mutation {
  deleteCharacter(id: "1") {
     success
     message
  }
}
```

## Configuration
- Port and data-source options are typically set via environment variables (e.g., PORT, DATA_FILE). Check the project entry script for exact variable names.

## Testing
Run tests (if included):
- npm: `npm test`
- yarn: `yarn test`

## Project structure (typical)

  - schema.js          # GraphQL schema and resolvers
  - server.js          # Server bootstrap
  - data/              # Optional file-based seed or store
- package.json
- README.md
